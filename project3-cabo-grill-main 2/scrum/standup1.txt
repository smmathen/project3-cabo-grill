- For Shawn, the big idea was to figure out what we wanted to use for our project 3. After doing some research between Java Spring and React, he thought that React was more viable for this project.
- The plan for today is to set up the git repository with some of the beginner template code for a React js project. 
- Blockers are to learn React, Javascript, and HTML.

- Similarly, Nicholus stated that there was some research done into what to use for project 3. He was impartial to any choice, so went along with the choice for React.
- There is some learning curve with React especially since there hasn't been any prior experience, so plan is to learn as much as possible soon.
- Blockers are to learn Javascript, and HTML, and React.

- For Soohwan, he knew React and advocated strongly for it. 
- He wanted to start creating some of the navbar components in Next.js so that we could get the ball rolling.
- No real blockers yet since project has yet to start.

- Kavya also did research but advocated moreso for Java Spring, however changed her mind as the team though implementation of features and APIs would be easier to do in React.
- Her plan is to start understanding how React works and what can be done for the project.
- No blockers yet
