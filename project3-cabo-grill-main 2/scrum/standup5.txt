- Soohwan has finished the authentication for servers and managers. He saved their information in the local storage so their login status can be maintained, even if they leave the page. He added logout as well, which deletes the information from the website.
- He wants to replace the login button with employee button so that we have a better accessibility between the login page and server page based on if a user is logged in or not.
- He doesn't think there are many blockers and he has made a lot of progress.

-  Nicholus has been trying to reformat how the manager pages are presented in the backend, so that he can fix some navigation issues. 
-  Nicholus wants to make the manager be able to edit table and also create a nicer format than what we have. He is still having port issues, but he thinks he knows the issue. 
-  He can see the data but is having trouble parsing it, so he wants to work on that.

- Kavya has been connecting the backend data for the server from the data to the buttons so that the server can start takiing orders.
- Today, she wants to at least get the menu buttons to show up from the database rather than hardcoded values.
- There aren't really any significant blockers since she has been working on the server backend as a whole. She is mainly just determined to finish her backend functionality.

- Shawn worked on more Project Manager documents to keep the group ahead of schedule, especially compared to the first sprint. He also worked on hosting the current code on Render so that the team could experiment with what the site looks like on the internet.
- He wants to fine tune some of the database calls because it seems to be slow on render, but that may just be due to Render's resources. He also wants to finish up documentation as the sprint end is coming soon.
- After figuring out render, he doesn't have any real blockers other than trying to help out more with the backend/ frontend when he is not doing the project management duties.
